## One Game a Month: Stuck in a Loop

My first game for the **One Game a Month** challenge. I picked the previous Ludum Dare theme `stuck in a loop` to help me get started with an idea. The game is very loosely based around the theme. Read more [here](https://lehaine.com/one-game-a-month-stuck-in-a-loop).

Based from [Deepnights](https://deepnight.net)'s [GameBase](https://github.com/deepnight/gameBase).

## Setup

Install all haxelibs:
`haxelib install all`

Check the `ldtk-haxe-api` version if you are using a new template. There maybe a newer version out.
