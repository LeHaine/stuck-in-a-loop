## One Game a Month: Stuck in a Loop

My first game for the **One Game a Month** challenge. I picked the previous Ludum Dare theme `stuck in a loop` to help me get started with an idea. The game is very loosely based around the theme. Read more [here](https://lehaine.com/one-game-a-month-stuck-in-a-loop).

Play it [here](https://lehaine.com/mind-loop).
